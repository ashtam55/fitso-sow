<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This documentation is to serve as a ‘Statement of Work’ or SOW for implementing few Digital Transformations at a Fitso facility to enhance and empower Administrations. The advancement in the field of IoT, Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems that can really help business. Such a system would include a means to capture, catalog and analyze data, along with tools to enforce ‘business logic’.</p>
<p>Akriya Technologies will work with Fitso to: * Desing the Smart Fitso Facility Architecture * Identify options to integrate various systems - both Fitso Internal and External * Develop and Engineer the system * Deploy said system to a Fitso Facility * Provide documentation of the new system * Knowledge Transfer/Integrate with Fitso Tech team</p>
<p>Akriya Technologies proposes to design, develop and provide installation of v1.0 of the proposed system to 1 Fitso Facility. This activity will require 8 weeks. The estimated cost for this activity would be 2 lakhs INR plus per device cost which averages around 4000 INR.</p>
<p>The Value Proposition of using Akriya Technologies for this project are: * Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems. * Leveraging our experience in working with IoT toolkit (ESP) to bootstrap your effort. * Using our subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost saving quickly.</p>
