# Week 1 Fitso

## Agenda 
In-facility device for LPS Pool facility of Fitso, that measures Humidity and Temperature and transmits sensor values via HTTP endpoints.


## Rough work items
* Getting the Hardware up and running with the desired sensors.
* PCB designing and fabrication for the In-facility device
* Product form-factor designing and manufacturing.
* On-device controller logic to interface with sensors and transmit data
* development + testing

## Timelines for the week*
* Before 28th January:
    * Invoicing, documentation, and source required Hardware.
    * Visit of facility

* 30th January 
    * Working prototype

* 1st February
    * Installation/Testing at Fitso Facility


## Expectations
* The fabrication of the PCB and the Module's housing are subject to availability and might extend beyond 1st February. In such a scenario, I will be installing the device with manual soldering and 3D printed casing until the final version is ready.

* The API endpoints that the device would hit be provided by Fisto's tech team in a pre-defined Schema. Until this is the scenario, I would be exposing a repository (used for development purposes) with the last 15 days of data.

* All source code for the device controller would be shared with Fitso.

* The Module housing provided would be stock, if any changes are required, we can discuss.

* At the end of Week 1 tasks, Fitso will have schematics, source code, and documentation to manufature its own in-facility device or get it manufactured by us for the base cost.
